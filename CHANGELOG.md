# Changelog

Notable changes to vdjtools v2. Releases before 3.0.0 are recorded in the git tags
(`v2.5.0` … `v2.9.0`) and their commit history.

## Unreleased

- Consolidated the example notebooks: the old `notebooks/` directory was merged into
  **`examples/`**, so every marimo explorer now lives under `examples/` (docs / README / skills
  updated to match). Examples are not shipped in the wheel — this is a repository-layout change only.

## 3.0.0

### Added — longitudinal clonotype dynamics (`vdjtools.dynamics`)

- **Recapture model** (`dynamics.capture`) — the VDJtrack size-bucket model: clonotypes binned
  singleton / doubleton / tripleton / large, Poisson capture probability `P = 1 − exp(−f·R)`,
  `Beta(captured, missing)` credible intervals, and the group-effect test — a log-linear
  `log(recapture) ~ size + group + log(div_ratio)` plus a per-bucket paired t-test across donors.
  Python port of Pavlova, Zvyagin & Shugay, *Front Immunol* 2024
  ([10.3389/fimmu.2024.1321603](https://doi.org/10.3389/fimmu.2024.1321603)).
- **Metaclonotype-grouped testing** (`dynamics.test_metaclonotypes`) — collapse a 1-Hamming
  (`scope="1,0,0,1"`) or 1-Levenshtein (`"1,1,1,1"`) CDR3 ball into one feature before the paired
  test, for power on convergent expansions.
- **edgeR NB-exact caller** (`dynamics.expansion_test`) — TMM normalization + qCML common
  dispersion + the negative-binomial exact test (as a Beta-Binomial conditional); the paper's §2.5
  complementary per-clone caller.

  (Complements the existing per-clonotype `dynamics.test_pair`, Ayestaran 2024.)

### Added — cohort-streaming summary statistics

- `io.map_samples(fn, items, *, workers=)` — thread-parallel per-sample reduce, `O(workers)`-sample
  peak memory, results in input order.
- `stats.diversity_cohort(cohort)` — the whole cohort's diversity table in one streamed
  count-spectrum pass, bit-exact vs the per-sample path.
- A `by=["sample_id"]` group-prefix on `spectratype` / `vj_spectratype` / `segment_usage` /
  `vj_usage` / `kmer_profile` / `v_kmer_c_profile` / `physchem_profile` — the whole cohort in one
  fused `group_by` over a `scan_cohort` LazyFrame.
- CLI `diversity` / `spectratype` / `segment-usage` / `overlap` gain `--threads N` (parallel over
  samples) and `--cohort DIR` (one streamed pass over a pre-ingested Parquet cohort); the `overlap`
  command now pre-aggregates each sample once.

### Added — CLI & packaging

- New `vdjtools` subcommands: **`convert`** (read any supported format — native / AIRR / Parquet /
  MiXcr / MiGec / MiTCR / immunoSEQ / IMGT / Vidjil / RTCR / TRUST4 / arda — and write the canonical
  table), **`downsample`**, **`filter`** (coding / non-coding / frequency / V-J segment), and
  **`pool`** (flat pool or incidence `--join`).
- Every command's `-o` is now **format-aware**: a `.parquet` / `.pq` path writes Parquet, anything
  else (or stdout) writes TSV.
- Development switched to **uv** — one repo-local `.venv`, no conda. `setup.sh` is rewritten to be
  uv-first (with a `python -m venv` fallback) and **portable across bash and zsh**. `environment.yml`
  is now optional, needed only for MMseqs2 (arda's aligner) + the slow arda round-trip tests.

### Added — notebooks (marimo, `[examples]` extra)

- `examples/vaccination_tracking.py` — clonotype tracking + recapture model across YFV / influenza
  / TBE vaccination time courses.
- `examples/aging.py` — cohort-streaming diversity / clone-size / spectratype across the Britanova
  ageing cohort.
- `examples/ankspond_motif.py` — the ankylosing-spondylitis TRBV9 "AS27" motif (disease vs HLA-B27
  carriage; Komech 2018).

### Fixed

- **C++ CI version drift** — the native `version()` is now single-sourced from `pyproject.toml`
  (parsed by CMake into the `VDJTOOLS_VERSION` compile definition), and both the C++ and Python
  version tests assert *agreement* rather than a hand-copied literal. A release bump can no longer
  redden CI (as the 2.9.0 bump did, leaving `tests/cpp/test_core.cpp` asserting `"2.8.0"`).
